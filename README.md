Dive right in. 

## :scroll: About
This app was made using Vanilla JS and uses only a single page. The API used is omdbapi.com. 

## :pencil2: Usage

Firstly clone this repo into your projects. You will need an API key for this, so register to get one for free at omdbapi.com. It will only take a minute or two. 

Create a file in the directory you cloned called config.js, and edit the following code with your API key

```
var config = {
  apiKey: "YOUR API GOES HERE"
}
```

That's all folks! Open the index.html in your browser and get watching!
